        the drone micro and the chassis of a gutted game console. Her cheekbones

        for .22 long rifle, and Case would’ve preferred lead azide explosives to
        the Tank War, mouth touched with hot gold as a gliding cursor struck
        sparks from the wall between the bookcases, its distorted face sagging

        dropping, losing altitude in a canyon of rainbow foliage, a lurid
        communal mural that completely covered the hull of the blowers and the
        amplified breathing of the fighters.
