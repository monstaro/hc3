This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is the official web site for Denver band, 'hellocentral'. 
It's a relatively simple web page that gives the visitor easy access to other social media links, as well as some typical pages you'd expect on a band/artist website (pics, about, merch, contact, music).

The design was conceived by myself, the intention was a very simple, easy-to-navigate layout.

Live site: http://www.hellocentral.live
